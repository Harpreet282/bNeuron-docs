# Introduction

The Admin Panel serves as the central control system of the AI automation platformâ€”empowering administrators, builders, and operations teams to create, manage, deploy, and monitor intelligent AI agents across multiple departments and channels.

This robust backend interface offers full visibility and control over the platformâ€™s workflows, users, data sources, integrations, and performance analytics. It is designed with a modular, intuitive layout that enables both technical and non-technical users to configure complex AI behaviors with minimal effort.

From low-code flow building and agent configuration to real-time analytics, user management, and multi-channel deploymentâ€”every aspect of the platform can be accessed and orchestrated through the Admin Panel.
